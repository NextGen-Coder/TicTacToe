# Tic Tac Toe Game

Games provide a real source of enjoyment in daily life. They are not only fun but also helpful in improving the physical and mental health of humans. Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that can be played between two players on a 3x3 block using noughts (O) and crosses (X).

## How to Play:

- The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
- Players take turns placing their symbol (X or O) in an empty cell of the grid.
- The objective is to create a combination of 3 same symbols in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.

## Rules:

- Player 1 uses the symbol X, and Player 2 uses the symbol O.
- The game starts with an empty grid, and players take turns to make a move.
- A player wins if they have 3 of their symbols in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- If all cells are filled, and no player has won, the game is considered a draw.

## Layouts:

There are two layouts available for playing Tic Tac Toe:

### 1. One-Sided Layout:
